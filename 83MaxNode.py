"""
Day 83 coding Statement :

Given a complete binary tree with the height of H, we index the nodes respectively top-down and left-right from 1. 
The i-th node stores a positive integer Vi. Define Pi as follows: Pi=Vi if the i-th node is a leaf, otherwise Pi=max(ViPL, ViPR), 
where L and R are the indices of the left and right children of i, respectively. Your task is to caculate the value of P1.

Input
There are several test cases (fifteen at most), each formed as follows:
The first line contains a positive integer H (H â‰¤ 15). The second line contains 2H-1 positive integers (each having a value of 109 at most),
 the i-th integer shows the value of Vi. The input is ended with H = 0.

Output
For each test case, output on a line an integer which is the respective value of P1 found, by modulo of 1,000,000,007.
