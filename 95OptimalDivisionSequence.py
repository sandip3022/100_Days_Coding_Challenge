"""
Day 95 coding Statement :
Kulyash is given an integer N. His task is to break N into some number of (integer) powers of 2.
To achieve this, he can perform the following operation several times (possibly, zero):
Choose an integer X which he already has, and break X into 2 integer parts (Y and Z) such that X=Y+Z. Find the minimum number of operations required by Kulyash to accomplish his task.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line of input. The first and only line of each test case 
contains an integer N â€” the original integer with Kulyash. Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations required by Kulyash to break N into powers of 2.
Sample Input
